# MetaRL-Agent-Emergence

**Multi-Agent Continual Skill Discovery with SSM-Based Meta-Learners**

## Overview

MetaRL-Agent-Emergence represents an advanced evolution in meta-reinforcement learning, focusing on **lifelong learning**, **emergent multi-agent coordination**, and **continual skill discovery** through state-space model (SSM) architectures. This project builds upon foundational work from [SSM-MetaRL-TestCompute](https://github.com/sunghunkwag/SSM-MetaRL-TestCompute) and extends it with significantly enhanced meta-learning capabilities, multi-agent orchestration, and AGI-relevant research directions.

## Foundational Reference

This work is directly inspired by and extends the **SSM-MetaRL-TestCompute** repository, which established the initial framework for integrating state-space models with meta-reinforcement learning. We acknowledge this foundational contribution and aim to amplify its impact through:

- **Stronger meta-learning mechanisms** for rapid adaptation
- **Multi-agent emergence dynamics** for collaborative skill discovery
- **Continual learning pipelines** to prevent catastrophic forgetting
- **Hierarchical skill abstraction** for transfer across task families

## Technical Vision

The core vision of MetaRL-Agent-Emergence is to develop autonomous agents capable of:

1. **Discovering and refining skills continuously** without human supervision
2. **Transferring learned behaviors** across diverse and evolving environments
3. **Coordinating with other agents** to achieve emergent collective intelligence
4. **Adapting meta-parameters** in real-time based on environmental feedback
5. **Building hierarchical skill libraries** that support compositional reasoning

### Key Architectural Components

- **SSM-Enhanced Policy Networks**: Leveraging state-space models (S4, S5, Mamba variants) for efficient long-range dependency modeling in policy learning
- **Meta-Learning Controller**: Higher-order optimization loop that tunes learning rates, exploration strategies, and skill selection policies
- **Multi-Agent Communication Protocol**: Differentiable message-passing architecture for emergent coordination
- **Continual Learning Module**: Experience replay with importance weighting, dynamic task rehearsal, and progressive neural networks
- **Skill Discovery Engine**: Intrinsic motivation mechanisms (curiosity, empowerment) integrated with meta-gradient signals

## Research Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Enhance Meta-Learning Robustness**
   - Implement second-order meta-gradient methods (MAML++, iMAML)
   - Integrate context-conditioned adaptation for faster few-shot learning
   - Develop meta-curriculum learning for progressive task difficulty

2. **Multi-Agent Skill Emergence**
   - Design decentralized learning protocols with centralized training
   - Study emergent communication and role specialization
   - Benchmark coordination on complex cooperative tasks

3. **Lifelong Learning & Transfer**
   - Prevent catastrophic forgetting through selective consolidation
   - Enable zero-shot transfer via learned skill embeddings
   - Build composable skill primitives for hierarchical planning

4. **AGI Research Alignment**
   - Investigate open-ended learning in procedurally generated environments
   - Explore self-supervised objective discovery
   - Contribute to understanding of artificial general intelligence pathways
